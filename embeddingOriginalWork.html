        <p>"Love Shot" acts as a follow-up single to EXO's recently released full-length album, Don't Mess Up My Tempo, which peaked at No. 23 on the all-genre Billboard 200 albums chart. It made the outfit the second-highest charting Korean act ever on the tally. Previous to "Love Shot," EXO had earned No. 1s on the World Digital Song Sales chart with 2016 singles "Monster" and "Lotto."</p>
